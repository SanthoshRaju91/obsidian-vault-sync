    You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great. - Zig ziggler  
      
    We are scared of being starting from the bottom.  
      
    Everyone we know have started from the bottom.  
      
    Spend time researching on the background stories / origin stories of someone who inspires your passion.  
      
    And getting to know their pain, the rejections and get to know their journey of someone getting their dreams to reality.  
      
    Obstacle is the way, failure is the way, rejection is the way.  
      
    Starting at the bottom is the only way.  
    
2.  Need to schedule time.  
      
    Get the time, when your full time job is taking care of your bills and payments and take that time to practice your passion.  
    
3.  Choosing education over entertainment.  
      
    If you don’t sacrifice for you what you want, what you want becomes the sacrifice.  
      
    Being passionate about something means liking it, addicted to it. Doesn’t mean being good or expert it or being leader in it.  
      
    Focus your energy and then get more freedom latter.  
      
    10-20% of their income invest in education over entertainment.  
      
    When you choose eduction you elevate and choosing entertainment you escape. Escaping via your ways.  
      
      
    Growing without community is not sustainable
